# ThreeJs-Examples
My goal is to create a simple repo that can host various three js renders that interact with music that a user can either upload or link.
There will be different rendering outputs depending on the frequency data that is generated by the Web Audio API. 

## Basic Progress
- User can upload a track and see a 2d visualization [x]
- Can generate a basic shape in the canvas [x]
- create at least 3 different scenes []
  - cubes [x]
  - web [x]
  - matrix []
  - abstract []
- Can generate an array of random shapes as a matrix [x]
- camera functions [x]
- have features of shape determined by song data[x]
  - color [x]
  - size [x]
- controls option to change certain things
  - camera rotation []
  - different shapes [] 
  - shape color []
  - shape size []
- option to choose different scenes []

## Tech/Tools
