# ThreeJs-Examples
My goal is to create a simple repo that can host various three js renders that interact with music that a user can either upload or link.
There will be different rendering outputs depending on the frequency data that is generated by the Web Audio API. 

## Basic Progress
- User can upload a track and see a 2d visualization [x]
- Can generate a basic shape in the canvas [x]
- create at least 3 different shapes or scenes
- Can generate an array of random shapes as a matrix [x]
  - possible random shapes
    - cylinder []
    - cone []
    - pyramid []
    - prism []
    - dodecahedron []
- can generate a random shape on every upload []
- camera functions [x]
- have features of shape determined by song data
  - color []
  - size []
  - amount of sizes []
  - rotation speed []

## Tech/Tools
Three.js with WebGL
  - VR options for Google Cardboard(bonus)
  - Optional Aframe
  - Geometry & Trigonometry
